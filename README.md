# composite-material-porous-media-effective-elastic-proprieties-automation

This project consists of different python scripts in the aim to automate the creation of composite materials-like finite elements meshes. As well as the calculation of the effective elastic proprieties of every given mesh using the finite elements method.

It is based on GMSH: https://gmsh.info/ python API for mesh creation. And SFEPY: https://sfepy.org/ for the finite elements analysis.
